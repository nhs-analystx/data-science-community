## Data Science Assembly

### What is it?

A group that represents those working in novel data science (both R&D and operational) in NHS England and NHS Digital.  

#### Why do we need it?
Representation from a strong and recognised Data Science function is important, to ensure novel approaches and techniques can feed into operational analytics, AI and beyond. In addition to experimenting/filtering R&D projects and recommending successful ones to operational analytics, we can provide important guidance/reference to the operational team in terms of the latest tech (e.g. algorithms/approaches, tools, tech stack, etc.) 

Currently, we may get asked individually, or not at all, to contribute to the development of:  
<ul>
<li>•	Data Science projects </li>
<li>•	Analytics tools, software and platforms</li> 
<li>•	Workforce, for example training and development for existing colleagues</li>
</ul>
The Data Science Assembly allows us to collaboratively contribute to these developments with a stronger and more consistent voice, to ensure the requirements of data science and innovative analytics are an appropriate part of future plans.  

### Who will be in it?

Members are from teams from NHS England and NHS Digital, with enthusiasm and experience in Data Science and innovative analytics.  

### What will it do?
We collectively represent the innovative analytics and data science community in NHS England and NHS Digital and have a focus on the following areas:  
<ul>
  <li>•	Internal tooling and platforms </li>
  <li>•	Open analytics, such as GitHub use </li>
  <li>•	Training and events, for example working with AnalystX </li>
  <li>•	Competency Frameworks</li>
  <li>•	Involvement in networks and communities such as NHS-R Community and NHS PyCom </li>

### How do we do this?
<ul>
  <li>•	Members form sub-groups and take forward key areas listed above </li>
  <li>•	We attend key stakeholder meetings </li>
<li>•	The Data Science Assembly meets regularly to feedback and decide on our collective actions/positions</li>
  </ul>

### What is it not?
<ul>
  <li>•	A team from which projects and data science outputs are commissioned (this still happens in separate teams) </li>
  </ul>
