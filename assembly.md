## Data Science Assembly

### What is it?

A group that represents those working in novel data science (both R&D and operational) in NHS England and NHS Digital.  

#### Why do we need it?
Representation from a strong and recognised Data Science function is important, to ensure novel approaches and techniques can feed into operational analytics, AI and beyond. In addition to experimenting/filtering R&D projects and recommending successful ones to operational analytics, we can provide important guidance/reference to the operational team in terms of the latest tech (e.g. algorithms/approaches, tools, tech stack, etc.) 

Currently, we may get asked individually, or not at all, to contribute to the development of:  
•	Data Science projects 
•	Analytics tools, software and platforms 
•	Workforce, for example training and development for existing colleagues 
The Data Science Assembly allows us to collaboratively contribute to these developments with a stronger and more consistent voice, to ensure the requirements of data science and innovative analytics are an appropriate part of future plans.  

### Who will be in it?

Members are from teams from NHS England and NHS Digital, with enthusiasm and experience in Data Science and innovative analytics.  

### What will it do?
We collectively represent the innovative analytics and data science community in NHS England and NHS Digital and have a focus on the following areas:  
•	Internal tooling and platforms 
•	Open analytics, such as GitHub use 
•	Training and events, for example working with AnalystX 
•	Competency Frameworks 
•	Involvement in networks and communities such as NHS-R Community and NHS PyCom 

### How do we do this?
•	Members form sub-groups and take forward key areas listed above 
•	We attend key stakeholder meetings 
•	The Data Science Assembly meets regularly to feedback and decide on our collective actions/positions 

### What is it not?
•	A team from which projects and data science outputs are commissioned (this still happens in separate teams)
